# Scrap Metal Classification

## Overview

The **Scrap Metal Classification** project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify different grades of scrap metal based on image data. This system is useful for automating the recycling process, reducing manual errors, and improving operational efficiency in material sorting.

```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/digvijaysingh1707/scrapmetal_classification.git
cd scrapmetal_classification
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, manually install dependencies found in the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn opencv-python tensorflow keras
```

You may also need `jupyter` if you plan to run the notebook:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

To explore training, preprocessing, and evaluation:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open `model_notebook.ipynb` and execute cells step-by-step.

### 4. Run the Model Script

If you're using the model in a script-based workflow:

```bash
python model.py
```

Ensure that paths and required configurations are updated inside the script as per your environment.

## Features

- Image classification for multiple scrap metal grades
- Jupyter notebook for easy understanding and experimentation
- Modular Python script for production or batch use
- Dataset organized for scalable training and validation
